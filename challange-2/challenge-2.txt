1. Create an input field(in App component) with a change listener wich outputs the length
of the entered text below(e.g in a paragraph).
2. Create a new component(=> ValidationComponent) which recieves the text as a prop.
3. Inside the ValidationComponent either output "Text too short" or "Text long enought"
depending on the text length(e.g take 5 as a minium length)
4 Create another component(=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=> display:inline-block),
padding: 16px, text-align:center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black).
5 Render a list of CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text.
6 When you click a CharComponent, it should removed from the entered text.

Hint: Keep in mind that JavaScript are basically arrays!
You'll also need to transform a string into a real array and then join it back into a string again to complete task 5 of the assignment.
You can split a string into an array of its characters with the split('')  method. By passing just an empty string, it's split after every character.
You may then re-create a string from that array by using join('')  - again, joining with an empty string as a separator.
